I am a first-year doctoral researcher at the Mathematical Institute, University of Oxford, pursuing the DPhil in Mathematics. I am co-supervised by Professors **Alain Goriely, Morten Kringelbach & Renaud Lambiotte**. I am a member of the [Oxford Mathematical Brain Modelling group](http://goriely.com/research/brain),  [Oxford Centre for Industrial & Applied Mathematics](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/groups/ociam), and the [Centre for Eudaimonia and Human Flourishing](https://hedonia.kringelbach.org/). Prior to this, I completed the Master's of Mathematics with study in Europe (MMath) at the University of Warwick where I graduated first class.

Research Interests
======
I have broad research interests in applied mathematics and computational science. I am particularly interested in computational neuroscience, complexity and data science. Currently, I am working on the modelling of neural dynamics and developing techniques in neural data science. I am seeking to understand how dynamics and data underpin brain function in health and disease by developing whole-brain computational models within a coupled oscillator network.

More generally, I hope to apply mathematical techniques from dynamical systems, network science, control theory, machine learning, data science and numerical analysis to problems in neuroscience and biology. I am further interested in biologically inspired machine learning and have completed research in numerical analysis for spiking neuron models.
