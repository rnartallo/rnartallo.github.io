I am a first-year doctoral researcher at the Mathematical Institute, University of Oxford, pursuing the DPhil in Mathematics. I am co-supervised by Professors **Alain Goriely, Morten Kringelbach & Renaud Lambiotte**. I am also a member of the Centre for Eudaimonia and Human Flourishing and St Catherine's College. Prior to this, I completed the MMath at the University of Warwick where I graduated first class.

Research Interests
======
I have broad research interests in applied mathematics and computational science, particularly computational neuroscience and modelling of neural function. I hope to apply mathematical techniques from dynamical systems, control theory, machine learning and numerical analysis to problems in neuroscience. I am particularly interested in whole-brain computational modelling, biologically inspired neural networks and numerical analysis for spiking neuron models.
