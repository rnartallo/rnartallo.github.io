I am a second-year doctoral researcher at the Mathematical Institute, University of Oxford, pursuing the DPhil in Mathematics. I am co-supervised by Professors **Alain Goriely, Renaud Lambiotte & Morten Kringelbach**. I am a member of the [Oxford Mathematical Brain Modelling group](http://goriely.com/research/brain),  [Oxford Centre for Industrial & Applied Mathematics](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/groups/ociam), and the [Centre for Eudaimonia and Human Flourishing](https://hedonia.kringelbach.org/). Prior to this, I completed the Master's of Mathematics with study in Europe (MMath) at the University of Warwick where I graduated first class.

Research Interests
======
I have broad research interests in applied mathematics and computational science. I am working at the interface of complex systems, networks and data science researching how to model and analyse neuroimaging within this framework. Currently, I am working on developing methods and theory for analysing the **nonequilibrium (thermo)dynamics of neuroimaging data** using tools from statistical physics and data science. More generally, I hope to apply mathematical techniques from dynamical systems, network science, machine learning and data science to problems in neuroscience and biology.
