I am a first-year doctoral researcher at the Mathematical Institute, University of Oxford, pursuing the DPhil in Mathematics. I am co-supervised by Professors **Alain Goriely, Morten Kringelbach & Renaud Lambiotte**. I am a member of the Oxford Mathematical Brain Modelling group, Oxford Centre for Industrial & Applied Mathematics, and the Centre for Eudaimonia and Human Flourishing. Prior to this, I completed the Master's of Mathematics with study in Europe (MMath) at the University of Warwick where I graduated first class.

Research Interests
======
I have broad research interests in applied mathematics and computational science. I am particularly interested in computational neuroscience and the modelling of neural dynamics. I am seeking to understand how they underpin brain function in health and disease by developing whole-brain computational models within a coupled oscillator framework.

More generally, I hope to apply mathematical techniques from dynamical systems, control theory, machine learning and numerical analysis to problems in neuroscience. I am further interested in biologically inspired machine learning and have completed research in numerical analysis for spiking neuron models.
